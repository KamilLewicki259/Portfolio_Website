      <p>With the theoretical as well as practical languages and framework experience, I’ve undertaken 
      numerous personal projects that have served as a great learning experience, some of them include a 
      3D game which is currently still ongoing within the Unity game engine as well as multiple multi page 
      websites.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Project 1</u>: Focussing on gameplay mechanics as well as story with an RPG style game is still 
            ongoing, being updated regularly the more I learn within the game industry.</li>
        <li><u>Project 2</u>: Focusing on the gameplay aspects and less so on the story, this project is an FPS style game which is being updated as my skills develop</li>
        <li><u>Project 3</u>: A website which houses my portfolio as well as an insight into my life and my 
            everything I’ve learned when training as a Full-stack web developer.</li>
        <li><u>Project 4</u>: As a member of a small team of likeminded people, I’m undertaking more complex 
            3D asset modelling to sharpen my artistic skills. This goes hand in hand with my project 1 
            and 2 which also uses a lot of 3D assets.</li>
        <li>Experience with lighting, VFX, animation, texture mapping and 3D</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These projects are available for review by any interviewer upon request. Along with these projects, 
      I’ve participated in different challenges like game jams which usually put you up against the clock.</p>
